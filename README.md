ðŸŽ¯ Objective
The aim is to empower law enforcement agencies with data-driven insights to shape targeted policing strategies. By harnessing the power of machine learning, we delve deep into historical shooting incident data to classify incidents as fatal or non-fatal. This model isn't just a toolâ€”it's a strategic asset, shedding light on the critical factors that influence fatality rates and enabling a laser focus on high-priority areas.

ðŸš€ Project Overview
In this project, we develop a robust machine learning model aimed at predicting the outcome of shooting incidentsâ€”whether they result in fatalities or not. By analyzing key features within the data, we can predict the likelihood of a shooting incident being fatal, thereby assisting in proactive law enforcement and policy-making.
